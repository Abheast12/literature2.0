# Cursor Rules for "literature" codebase

## 1. Navigation
- `root/`: project root; contains `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`
- `client/src/pages/`: entry points for React routes (landing, lobby, game)
- `client/src/features/`: per‐feature UI & hooks
- `server/src/`: backend logic: controllers, sockets, services
- Shared TS types live in `shared/types/` and imported by both sides.

## 2. File Naming & Conventions
- React components in `PascalCase.tsx`; hooks as `useXxx.ts`
- State slices in `*.slice.ts`; services in `*.service.ts`
- Socket handlers named `.socket.ts`; REST handlers named `.controller.ts`
- Constants & enums in `*.constants.ts`

## 3. Jump‐to & Context
- Always open <file> at function/component definition when given a symbol.
- When editing a function or method, load at least ±30 lines around signature.

## 4. Editing
- Wrap new code in appropriate feature folder.
- Adhere strictly to existing TS types; update shared types first if new shape needed.
- Avoid changing lines outside requested feature unless bug‐fix.

## 5. Commits
- Make small, focused changes per commit; reference issue or TODO in commit message.
